Welcome to markinternaut.com

Hi, Internauts! I go by the name of Mark Internaut who is fascinated by website development, gaming, computers, and technology. The reason why this website is built is that I wanted to share information, tips, and techniques about all the stuff that I am really into. It will surely help others and also I can have the freedom to share my thoughts.

If you are also a business owner and want to create a website, contact me at [markinternaut@gmail.com](mailto:markinternaut@gmail.com). I do Shopify development and WordPress customization.

I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@markinternaut){:target="_blank"} also where I upload website development tutorials, mostly e-commerce websites, which create this experience even more enjoyable. I wish you subscribe and appreciate my content.

Thank you for taking the moment to read this.
