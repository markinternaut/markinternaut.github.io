Finding certified dropshipping suppliers can be difficult, and searching for “dropshipper” on the internet without coming across hundreds of scammers and middlemen is nearly impossible.

The majority of the results you’ll find online are from companies claiming to be dropshippers, but their quality and pricing are far inferior to what you’ll find when dealing with legitimate dropshippers.

Patience is required when looking for a drop-ship company.

Certified dropshippers do not charge setup or monthly fees. So, if a company claims to be a “dropshipper” or has drop ship websites and asks for a setup fee, monthly fee, or annual fee, that’s an immediate red flag.

## 1. Research Diligently
Once you’ve decided on the products you want to sell, research which dropshipping providers are available and which ones best meet your needs. You may need to choose between a domestic and an international provider depending on whether you’re dropshipping beyond the US or catering to local customers. When selecting suppliers, consider raw material sourcing, delivery timelines, and service potential.

## 2. Find Approachable Suppliers
Establish a relationship with the dropshipping supplier who best meets your requirements. By speaking with them, you can ask them questions about the services they offer. They may even provide you with contact information for some of their current clients so you can get hands-on experience working with them before making a commitment.

Maintaining a positive relationship with your dropshipping suppliers from the start ensures trust when you begin doing business together. As a result, it will be easier to get questions answered quickly and disagreements resolved quickly. After all, you’re on the same team.

Many suppliers may appear to be fantastic when you look at their ratings and the products they offer, but when you dig deeper into the business, they may not be right for your target market. This could be because of the raw materials they use, their business practices, or the way they handle returns. Before agreeing to work with a supplier, talk to them and learn about their business practices. Although you have the option of terminating service with a provider if problems arise, the damage may already be done and your brand may have been harmed.

## 3. Observe What the Supplier Uses
Despite the fact that many dropshipping suppliers have outdated websites, many good suppliers invest in technology to help clients’ operations run more smoothly. Features such as searchable order history, customized data feeds, and a comprehensive product catalog benefits online merchants.

Some vendors have automated systems in place that allow you to place orders via email. This may appear to be a minor advantage, but it is actually a time saver for store owners because you won’t have to phone in every order or manually enter it on the supplier’s website. Just send an email.

## 4. Request for Product Samples
Once you’ve decided who you want to do business with, order samples from your top two or three suppliers. Test the quality of their service, shipping times, packaging, and any other supplier-related questions you may have so that you are completely satisfied with your decision.

Ordering product samples from a dropship supplier is an important part of the supplier selection process because it allows you to see how your customers interact with your company firsthand.

## 5. Check the Competitors
If one of your competitors uses the same supplier as you, you can find out how the supplier packages their products and offers services like custom labeling. If your competitor uses other suppliers, you can order from them to get a sense of the level of service you must provide in order to compete.

## Final Thoughts
Finding the best supplier for your dropshipping products can be a daunting task if you are just starting your dropshipping business or if you are an established online store looking to try out a new dropshipping product. There are several ways to find the right manufacturer or supplier, including looking within your own country or sourcing from outside.

Remember that no matter what method of sourcing you use, there will be advantages and disadvantages. Look for suppliers or manufacturers you can easily negotiate with. This allows you to devote more time to market your dropshipping business and less time to dealing with supplier issues.
